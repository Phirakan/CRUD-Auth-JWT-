#This is the basic and straightforward structure of a CRUD system using Golang and MySQL.

The system includes the following:

Create: Creating a Product
Read: Retrieving a Product
Update: Editing or updating product details
Delete: Deleting a Product
Authentication System
The system includes Login & Register functionalities, along with the generation of JWT (JSON Web Token). It also separates functions between the user and admin roles.

This project is created by someone who is just starting to learn Golang and wants to share this information with others who are new to the language.
Feel free to adapt it to fit your own project needs.

##Enjoy using this system. Thank you!
